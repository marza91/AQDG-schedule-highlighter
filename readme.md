Simple script for highlighting the current event at https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule
Also adds a button on the top for scrolling down to it.
Made by me, feel free to use in any way.
I have done some testing, but no guarantees of any kind.

Best way to use right now is to save the script as a bookmarklet and run it on the page.
Running it multiple time should work as well (maybe use a timer if it's added to the page?)
