<p>Simple script for highlighting the current event at https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule</p>
<p>Also adds a button on the top for scrolling down to it.</p>
<p>Made by me, feel free to use in any way.</p>
<p>I have done some testing, but no guarantees of any kind.</p>
<p>Best way to use right now is to save the script as a bookmarklet and run it on the page.</p>
<p>Running it multiple time should work as well (maybe use a timer if it's added to the page?)</p>
